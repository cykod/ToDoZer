# Make sure you have Rails installed

Run
   
    rails -v 

It should return

    Rails 3.2.8


# Create your rails app

Run
    
    rails new todozer

This should create a new rails application and list a bunch of new files just created in a new `todozer` subdirectory.

Go into that new directory and list the directory:

    cd todozer
    ls -la
